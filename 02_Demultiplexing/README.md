This folder contains scripts used for demultiplexing of sequencing data that underwent basecalling.
Index files contain information for samples from other research projects. Samples from several projects including Tridacna microbiome project were sequenced in the same run.

Demultiplexed sequencing data is publicly available under DRA accession numbers DRR634277-DRR634314 with the BioProject accession number PRJDB19983 and BioSample accession number SAMD00875503-SAMD00875540.
