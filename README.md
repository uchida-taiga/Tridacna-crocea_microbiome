Scripts for *Tridacna crocea* microbiome analysis (Uchida et al., Environmental Microbiology, under review).

When the same analysis was performed for both the tissue-specific microbiome and the dark-induced bleaching experiments, the scripts for the former are provided as representative examples.

Sequencing data is publicly available under DRA accession numbers DRR634277-DRR634314 with the BioProject accession number PRJDB19983 and BioSample accession number SAMD00875503-SAMD00875540.
